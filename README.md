# Data-Cleaning-Course
Repository for Data Cleaning Course Assignment
This is the culminating project in the Data Cleaning Course; one of the courses necessary to obtain the data science certificate through Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.

There is only one script contained in the repository, called run_analysis.R.  This is the script that is designed to produce the files and analyses along with the final output file for submission to this github repository.  The input data comes from the link:

and a full description of the data is at the following link:

The data has been unzipped and is contained in a folder on my local machine's drive at:

C:\Cleaning Data\Final Assignment\UCI HAR Dataset

All data is contained in this folder and is referenced in the programming script.
